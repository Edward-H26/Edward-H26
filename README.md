### 🚀 About Me

My name is Qiran Hu and I have a degree of Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Information Science with minors in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Illinois At Urbana-Champaign. I am passionate about the intersection of data science, machine learning, and computer vision. I aim to contribute to creating robust systems that learn and adapt efficiently with minimal human supervision and limited datasets by developing and applying advanced machine learning and generative models to address a range of complex tasks. These include the synthesis of realistic data, enhancing 3D scene understanding by computational systems, and extracting actionable insights from diverse datasets. 

I am eager to apply these skills and enhance my knowledge through impactful internships and research opportunities. Based on my experiences in artificial intelligence, 3D image reconstruction, data analysis techniques, I am excited applying these skills to innovative areas such as using machine learning to make systems smarter and more adaptive, utilizing data analysis to find those really impactful insights, and exploring how computer vision can help create more intelligent and interactive 3D worlds. 

Please do not be hesitant to get in touch with me at your earliest convenience if you have any inquiries or comments.

**Realistic Neural Style Transfer Architecture**

* **Repository:** [Edward-H26/Realistic-Neural-Style-Transfer-Architecture](https://github.com/Edward-H26/Realistic-Neural-Style-Transfer-Architecture)
* **Summary:** This project improves traditional Neural Style Transfer that uses a pre-trained VGG19 model to artistically blend the content of one image with the style of another. The implementation defines content loss to preserve structural features and style loss using Gram matrices to capture texture patterns. Through iterative optimization with various proposed methods, it generates stylized images that maintain the original content while adopting the artistic style.
