### 🚀 About Me

My name is Qiran Hu and I have a degree of Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Information Science with minors in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Illinois At Urbana-Champaign. I am passionate about the intersection of data science, machine learning, and computer vision. I aim to contribute to creating robust systems that learn and adapt efficiently with minimal human supervision and limited datasets by developing and applying advanced machine learning and generative models to address a range of complex tasks. These include the synthesis of realistic data, enhancing 3D scene understanding by computational systems, and extracting actionable insights from diverse datasets. 

I am eager to apply these skills and enhance my knowledge through impactful internships and research opportunities. Based on my experiences in artificial intelligence, 3D image reconstruction, data analysis techniques, I am excited applying these skills to innovative areas such as using machine learning to make systems smarter and more adaptive, utilizing data analysis to find those really impactful insights, and exploring how computer vision can help create more intelligent and interactive 3D worlds.

**Realistic Neural Style Transfer Architecture**
* **Repository:** [Edward-H26/Realistic-Neural-Style-Transfer-Architecture](https://github.com/Edward-H26/Realistic-Neural-Style-Transfer-Architecture)
* **Summary:** This project explores advanced techniques in Neural Style Transfer (NST) with a focus on generating more realistic and coherent stylized images. It implements and evaluates a PhotoRealistic-Style-Transfer model, likely based on the paper "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network." The repository contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of NST, including loading VGG19 for feature extraction, defining content and style losses, and processing images. The core idea is to apply the stylistic features of one image to the content of another while aiming to preserve photorealism. This research-oriented project delves into the intricacies of loss functions and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high-quality style transfer.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, TensorFlow (specifically `tf.keras` for model building and VGG19), NumPy, Matplotlib (for image display), PIL (Pillow for image manipulation), `functools.partial` (for function customization).

* **Summary:** This project is an interactive web application built with R and Shiny, designed to help users explore restaurants in Kyoto. It features dynamic filtering options based on criteria such as cuisine type, price range, and ratings from sources like Tabelog and TripAdvisor. Users can view restaurant locations on an interactive map (Leaflet) and access detailed profiles, including images and opening hours. The application demonstrates skills in data manipulation, UI/UX design using Shiny (with `shinydashboard` for layout and `shinythemes` for appearance), and deploying R-based web applications. The dataset includes comprehensive information about Kyoto restaurants, which is processed and presented in a user-friendly interface with features like word clouds and dynamic tables (DT package).
* **Technologies Used:** R, Shiny (specifically `shiny`, `shinydashboard`, `shinythemes`, `shinycssloaders`), Leaflet (for interactive maps), dplyr (for data manipulation), readr (for data import), ggplot2 (for plotting, though Leaflet is primary for maps), DT (for interactive tables), wordcloud2, purrr, stringr, jsonlite, httr. The UI is defined in `ui.R` and server logic in `server.R`.

* **Repository:** [Edward-H26/Machine-Learning-Research](https://github.com/Edward-H26/Machine-Learning-Research)
* **Summary:** This project, focusing on "Fake News Detection," meticulously executes a natural language processing pipeline. The initial **data preprocessing** phase involves crucial text cleaning steps to standardize the input and tokenization to break down text into individual units. Following this, **feature extraction** is performed using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, which converts the textual data into a numerical format that highlights the importance of words relevant to specific documents within the corpus. The core of the project lies in the **implementation and evaluation of a diverse set of machine learning classifiers**. These include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors. Each classifier's performance is systematically assessed to determine its effectiveness in distinguishing fake news.
* **Technologies Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas (for data manipulation), NumPy (for numerical operations), scikit-learn (for TF-IDF, various classifiers, model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, classification report), NLTK (for natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization), Matplotlib & Seaborn (for plotting and visualization), XGBoost, LightGBM. The project includes dataset loading (`.csv` files) and model training/evaluation pipelines.
